Rules
The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is more advantageous.
You start with two cards and can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stay" (keep your current hand).
If your hand value exceeds 21, you lose (bust).
After you complete your turn, the dealer draws cards until their hand value is at least 17.
The player with the hand closest to 21 without busting wins.

Getting Started
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have C# and .NET SDK installed.
Compile and run the Blackjack1 project in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).

Gameplay
Choose "Play Game" from the main menu to start a game.
Enter your bet amount (must be within your available money).
Follow the on-screen instructions to draw cards and decide whether to hit or stay.
After you decide to stay or bust, the dealer will play their hand.
The game will display the result, and your money will be updated accordingly.
You can choose to play again or exit the game from the main menu.
